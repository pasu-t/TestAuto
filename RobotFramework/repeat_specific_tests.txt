RobotFramework doesn't have option for repeating the testcases but we have the alternative way to acheive this.

Robot-framework will look for matching tests in all of the provided paths, if you pass the same path more than once, robot will run the same test again.

For example, if you are running tests on the current folder, you can pass "." as many times as you want the test to run. Ex:

robot -t "*My test*" . . .

This command will run all tests that match the expression 3 times, and the report will contain all 3 executions and results.
