Creating different reports and logs:
===================================
rebot output.xml
rebot path/to/output_file.xml
rebot --include smoke --name Smoke_Tests c:\results\output.xml

Combining outputs:
=================
rebot output1.xml output2.xml
rebot outputs/*.xml
rebot --include smoke --name Smoke_Tests c:\results\*.xml

Merging outputs:
================
If same tests are re-executed or a single test suite executed in pieces, combining results like discussed above creates an unnecessary top-level test suite.
In these cases it is typically better to merge results instead. 
How merging works in practice is explained in the following sections discussing its two main use cases.

Merging re-executed tests
--------------------------
robot --output original.xml tests                          # first execute all tests
robot --rerunfailed original.xml --output rerun.xml tests  # then re-execute failing
rebot --merge original.xml rerun.xml                       # finally merge results

Merging suites executed in pieces
---------------------------------
Another important use case for the --merge option is merging results got when running a test suite in pieces using, for example, --include and --exclude options:

robot --include smoke --output smoke.xml tests   # first run some tests
robot --exclude smoke --output others.xml tests  # then run others
rebot --merge smoke.xml others.xml               # finally merge results
