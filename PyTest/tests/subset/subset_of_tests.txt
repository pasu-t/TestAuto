You can run a subset of tests in several other ways. You can run all of the tests, or you can select a single directory, file, class within a file, or an individual test in a file or class. You haven’t seen test classes used yet, so you’ll look at one in this section. You can also use an expression to match test names.

An important trick to learn is that using -v gives you the syntax for how to run a specific directory, class, and test.

A SINGLE TEST FILE/MODULE 				pytest tests/func/test_add.py
A SINGLE TEST FUNCTION					pytest -v tests/func/test_add.py::test_add_returns_valid_id
A SINGLE TEST CLASS 					pytest -v tests/exceptions/test_api_exceptions.py::TestUpdate
A SINGLE TEST METHOD OF A TEST CLASS 	pytest -v tests/exceptions/test_api_exceptions.py::TestUpdate::test_bad_id
A SET OF TESTS BASED ON TEST NAME 		pytest -v -k _raises
										pytest -v -k "_raises and not delete"
