Parametrized Testing
Sending some values through a function and checking the output to make sure it’s correct is a common pattern in software testing. However, calling a function once with one set of values and one check for correctness isn’t enough to fully test most functions. Parametrized testing is a way to send multiple sets of data through the same test and have pytest report if any of the sets failed.
