Skipping Tests:
While the markers discussed in Marking Test Function were names of your own choosing, pytest includes a few helpful builtin markers: skip, skipif, and xfail.

The skip and skipif markers enable you to skip tests you don’t want to run.

Marking Tests as Expecting to Fail:
With the skip and skipif markers, a test isn’t even attempted if skipped. With the xfail marker, we are telling pytest to run a test function, but that we expect it to fail.
