Here are the possible outcomes of a test function:

PASSED (.): The test ran successfully.

FAILED (F): The test did not run successfully (or XPASS + strict).

SKIPPED (s): The test was skipped. You can tell pytest to skip a test by using either the @pytest.mark.skip() or pytest.mark.skipif() decorators, discussed in Skipping Tests.

XFAIL (x): The test was not supposed to pass, ran, and failed. You can tell pytest that a test is expected to fail by using the @pytest.mark.xfail() decorator, discussed in Marking Tests as Expecting to Fail.

XPASS (X): The test was not supposed to pass, ran, and passed.

ERROR (E): An exception happened outside of the test function, in either a fixture
